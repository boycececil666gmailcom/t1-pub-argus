# Argus

**README languages:** English · [日本語](README.ja.md) · [中文](README.zh.md)

> *Named after Argus Panoptes — the hundred-eyed giant of Greek mythology who never slept and watched everything.*

A Python tool that silently records which app and window you have active every 5 seconds. Run it in the background, then pull up a live dashboard or a rich terminal report to see exactly where your time goes.

---

## Stack

| Concern | Tool |
|---|---|
| Active window detection | `pywin32` (Windows) · `osascript` (macOS) · `xdotool` (Linux) |
| Idle detection | `GetLastInputInfo` via ctypes (Windows) · `ioreg` (macOS) · `xprintidle` (Linux) |
| Process info | `psutil` |
| Storage | SQLite via stdlib `sqlite3` |
| CLI | `Typer` |
| Terminal reports | `Rich` |
| Interactive dashboard | `Textual` |
| Auto-start | Registry key (Windows) · LaunchAgent plist (macOS) · XDG autostart (Linux) |

---

## Setup (development)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Linux only** — install two extra system packages for window and idle detection:
```bash
sudo apt install xdotool xprintidle   # Ubuntu / Debian
sudo dnf install xdotool xprintidle   # Fedora
```

---

## Building a standalone executable

Packages Argus into a single file that end users can run with no Python or pip required.

```bash
# Install build tools (one-time)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Build
python build.py
```

Output lands in `dist/`:

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| Windows | `dist/argus.exe` |
| Linux | `dist/argus` |
| macOS | `dist/argus` |

The executable is fully self-contained — Python, Textual, Rich, and all other dependencies are bundled inside it. **End users need to install nothing.**

> **Linux note:** `xdotool` and `xprintidle` are system packages that cannot be bundled. Include the following in any Linux distribution:
> ```bash
> sudo apt install xdotool xprintidle
> ```

## Usage (from source)

```bash
# Interactive dashboard (recommended — also runs the tracker in the background)
python src/main.py tui

# Start the tracker alone in the foreground (Ctrl+C to stop)
python src/main.py start

# Today's activity report
python src/main.py report

# Report for a specific day
python src/main.py report --date 2026-03-15

# This week's report
python src/main.py week

# What are you doing right now?
python src/main.py status

# Register Argus to launch automatically at login
python src/main.py install

# Remove from auto-start
python src/main.py uninstall
```

### Using the built executable

```bash
argus tui
argus report
argus install
# etc. — same commands, no "python src/main.py" prefix needed
```

## TUI dashboard

`python main.py tui` opens a live full-terminal dashboard powered by [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/). It also runs the tracker in the background — no separate `start` command needed.

**What it shows**

- **Status panel** — active app, category, window title, idle time, and total snapshot count
- **Today** — top 10 apps and category breakdown with progress bars
- **This Week** — day-by-day summary table plus weekly top apps and categories

Everything auto-refreshes every 5 seconds.

**Keyboard shortcuts**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `R` | Refresh all data immediately |
| `T` | Cycle through colour themes |
| `L` | Cycle through UI languages |
| `A` | Toggle Auto Start (enable / disable login launch) |
| `O` | Open the data folder in the file manager |
| `Q` | Quit |

**Toolbar buttons** (same actions, clickable)

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| `Auto Start  ON/OFF` | Toggle login auto-start |
| `EN  English` | Cycle language |
| `Open DB Folder` | Open data folder |

---

## Languages

The TUI supports 6 languages, cycled with `L`:

| Code | Language |
|---|---|
| `en` | English |
| `ja` | 日本語 |
| `zh` | 中文 |
| `fr` | Français |
| `de` | Deutsch |
| `es` | Español |

Your language choice is saved to `~/.argus/settings.json` and restored on next launch.

---

## Themes

Press `T` in the TUI to cycle through all 12 built-in Textual themes (no installs needed):

`textual-dark` · `textual-light` · `nord` · `gruvbox` · `catppuccin-mocha` · `catppuccin-latte` · `dracula` · `tokyo-night` · `monokai` · `solarized-dark` · `solarized-light` · `flexoki`

Your theme choice is also saved and restored automatically.

---

## Data

Everything is stored in `~/.argus/argus.db` (SQLite). One row per 5-second snapshot:

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ts` | REAL | Unix timestamp |
| `app_name` | TEXT | Process name (e.g. `chrome`, `code`) |
| `window_title` | TEXT | Window title at that moment |
| `exe_path` | TEXT | Full path to the executable |
| `idle` | INTEGER | 1 if no input for longer than the idle threshold |

Idle snapshots are excluded from all reports and the TUI by default.

User preferences (language, theme) are stored separately in `~/.argus/settings.json`.

---

## Categories

Apps are automatically bucketed into categories:

`Browser` · `IDE / Editor` · `Terminal` · `Communication` · `Design` · `Gaming` · `Productivity` · `Media` · `File Manager` · `System` · `Other`

To add or change mappings, edit the `CATEGORIES` dict in `argus/config.py`.

---

## Tuning

Edit the two constants at the top of `argus/config.py`:

```python
POLL_INTERVAL  = 5    # seconds between snapshots
IDLE_THRESHOLD = 60   # seconds of no input before a snapshot is marked idle
```
